## Datasets

The following datasets must be placed here for the notebooks to run:

- **dipping_obc**: `input_dipping_recsolid.npz` and `input_dipping_noseabed_recsolid.npz`.
   Contact the authors to obtain the following datasets;

- **salt**:  `S_mko.nc` and `R_FD_40Hz_z4400.nc`. Contact the authors to obtain the following datasets;

- **synthetic_volve**: ``input_full_volvesynth.npz``, ``input_nofs_full_volvesynth.npz``, ``input_nosea_full_volvesynth.npz``, and ``input_noseaflat_volvesynth.npz``. 
  Refer to the dataset [repository](https://github.com/DIG-Kaust/VolveSynthetic) for more details.
  
- **field_volve**: ``pup_shot*.bin`` and ``pdown_shot*.bin``. These have been created by performing basic pre-processing and wavefield separation (code not released) and can
  be obtained by contacting the authors. For more info about the original input Volve dataset used in this work, consult this [notebook](https://github.com/DIG-Kaust/VolveSynthetic/blob/main/Visualization/MainData.ipynb)
