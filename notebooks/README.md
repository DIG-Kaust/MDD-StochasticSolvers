# Notebooks

The notebooks are divided into five main directories:

* **Hyperbolic**:

  - ``Hyperbolic_MDD_basic.ipynb``: notebook performing a basic example of MDC and MDD for both single and multiple virtual sources
  - ``Hyperbolic_MDD_stochasticminibatch.ipynb``: notebook performing MDD on single virtual source with mini batch stochastic solvers
  - ``Hyperbolic_MDD_stochasticminibatch_numpy.ipynb``: same as above but purely implemented in numpy

* **Dipping_OBC**: 
  - ``WavefieldSeparation-dipping_MDD_basic.ipynb``**``: notebook performing wavefield separation for synthetic obc data with dipping seabed followed by standard MDD
  - ``WavefieldSeparation-dipping_MDD_steepest_singlesource.ipynb``: notebook performing MDD on single virtual source with steepest descent solver
  - ``WavefieldSeparation-dipping_MDD_stochastic_singlesource.ipynb``: notebook performing MDD on single virtual source with stochastic solvers
  - ``WavefieldSeparation-dipping_MDD_stochastic_singlesource_numpy.ipynb``: same as above but purely implemented in numpy
  - ``WavefieldSeparation-dipping_MDD_stochastic_singlesource_torch_vs_numpy.ipynb``: same as above but benchmark of torch vs numpy implementation
